title: About Me
---
Howdy. My name is Tyler and I'm a senior at [Marist College](https://www.marist.edu/) where I study computer science. I'm looking for full-time employment as a software engineer following my graduation in May, 2019.

### (Aspiring) Software Engineer üñ•

At Marist, I'm learning the fundamentals of computer science, like programming languages, data structures, and algorithms. In the summers of 2017 and 2018, I interned at ESPN. I contributed to some cool, but challenging projects and learned about the sports media business from a technological point of view.

### Singer üéµ

I've been a member of Marist Singers for all four years. My experience at Marist wouldn't be the same without the friendships I've made.

### Beach Lover ‚òÄÔ∏è

No explanation needed.

### Skier ‚õ∑Ô∏è

When winter rolls around, you can find me on the slopes. I'm a big fan of moguls.
