### Singer üéµ

I've been a member of Marist Singers all four years. I love being part of a choir and making music with friends. It's also a great way for me to take a break from staring at a computer monitor.

### Skier ‚õ∑Ô∏è

I love skiing with friends and family. I started when I was three at Mount Snow in Dover, Vermont. I'm a big fan of moguls.
