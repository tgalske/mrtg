# What's a keyboard shortcut?

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys, that when pressed simultaneously, trigger a function by the computer. One popular keyboard shortcut on Windows is `CTRL-ALT-DELETE`, which is usually used for accessing the Task Manager and then stopping a frozen program. The shortcuts below are targeted specifically for Chrome (Windows is an Operating System, Chrome is a web browser than runs on Windows).

# What's the purpose of a keyboard shortcut?

The biggest benefit of keyboard shortcuts is the amount of time saved from not having to take your right hand off the keyboard. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but if you break down the simple task of opening a new tab in Chrome, it requires placing your hand on the mouse, moving the cursor to the button on the screen, clicking, and then placing your hand back on the keyboard.



# A couple more things

* **If you have a Windows PC**, the `CTRL` (pronounced "control") key is used. It is located to the left of the spacebar. It is the bottom, leftmost key, below the shift button.
* **If you have a Mac**, the `CMD` (pronounced "command") key is used. It is located to the left of the spacebar.
* The shortcuts are described for Windows users. If you have a Mac, just swap the `CTRL` key for the `CMD` key. For example, to open a new tab in Windows, it's `CTRL-T`, but for Mac it's `CMD-T`.



# Shortcuts

## Open a new tab - `CTRL-T`

This is a handy shortcut because if you are using Chrome, chances are you'll be using two or more tabs at one point. One finger placement strategy is to drop your left pinky finer down to the `CTRL` key, and with your left index finger, press `T`.

You can remember this shortcut by knowing tab begins with T and the T key is used.

## Reopen the most recently closed tab - `CTRL-SHIFT-T`

Let's say you have two tabs open - one tab that has Gmail open and one tab that has Amazon open. You go to switch tabs and you accidentally close the Amazon tab. Instead of opening a new tab and retyping in the URL, try `CTRL-SHIFT-T`.

One finger placement strategy is to drop your left pinky finger down to the `CTRL` key, drop your left ring finger down to the `SHIFT` key, and with your index finger, press `T`. Your tab should reopen.

If you closed out of Chrome (by clicking the `X` in the top right corner) and want your tabs back, start Chrome again, and then press `CTRL-SHIFT-T`.



## Highlight all text - `CTRL-A`

Open a new tab and go to [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/). Start typing in some text, and then press CTRL-A. You'll notice the text you typed in gets highlighted.

_Why is this useful?_

The purpose of highlighting text is to manipulate or use it somehow - like copying, cutting, or deleting it. For example, let's say you are typing in the Amazon search bar, but want to delete what you typed and start over.

* The slow option: take your cursor, and drag your mouse along the text to highlight it. Then, start typing.
* The fast option ðŸ”¥: `CTRL-A`. Then start typing.

## Swift to a tab - `CTRL-1`, `CTRL-2`, `CTRL-3`, etc

Let's say you have two tabs open - Gmail on the left (tab 1) and Amazon on the right (tab 2). If you are swapping back and forth between them, try pressing `CTRL` and then the tab number. If you are in the Gmail tab and want to go to the Amazon tab, that would mean pressing `CTRL-2`. If you are in the Amazon tab and want to go back to the Gmail tab, press `CTRL-1`. If you want to access the fifth tab open, that would mean pressing `CTRL-5`. Get the idea?

One finger placement strategy is dropping your left pinky finger down to the CTRL key and extending your left middle finger up to the tab number.
